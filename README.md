# glut-examples
This repository contains a collection of simple OpenGL (GLUT) projects written in C. Each script demonstrates a different graphical concept or animation, such as object transformations, 2D/3D rendering, or basic interactive elements. These projects were created as part of my learning process with the GLUT toolkit.
